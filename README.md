# Financial Access Movement (FAM) Charter

## Mission Statement

The Financial Access Movement (FAM) exists to restore economic power to communities historically excluded from wealth-building systems by using blockchain technology, cooperative economics, and community ownership.

We believe financial access is a human right.

FAM is not controlled by banks, governments, or corporations. It is powered by people.

## Core Beliefs

1. Economic Unity

We believe communities should own assets together and share in growth, opportunity, and success.

3. Decentralized Access  
We believe blockchain technology allows everyday people to participate in systems once reserved for institutions.

4. Transparency  
All actions, records, and governance should remain publicly verifiable.
